# Encrypting and Decrypting app

I created this app for an NSI project at school and the goal was to make this app using the ROT13, Ceasar code, Vigenere cipher and the Polybius cipher. SO this app can do all these encryptment methods.
## Installation

To run the project you'll need three things:
- 3.12.8 python version
- install termcolor
- install pyfiglet

## Python version

First let's check your python version. If not installed yet, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3128/.

If it's already installed go to the **cmd** and enter :
~~~
python -v 
~~~
Then if it's the **3.12.8** version go to the next section, otherwise click on the previous link.

## Pip installation

Now before you install the 2 modules, let's check if you have any of the modules needed.

In the **cmd**, enter :
~~~
pip list
~~~
If you see any of the 2 modules needed, termcolor and pyfiglet, you can skip it's **own** installation process.

If neither of them are installed, entre in the **cmd** : 
~~~
pip install termcolor
~~~
Then this one :
~~~
pip install pyfiglet
~~~
Now you should have **both** needed modules, so let's go on the next section.
## Run the app

Now in the cmd you'll need to go in the folder of the app. To do so, you have to **follow** the tree to this folder:

In the **cmd** enter this : 
~~~
cd path\to\your\folder 
~~~
Then you can run it by entering 
~~~
python app.py
~~~
There you go, you should be running the app now !
